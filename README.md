# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
<p> The Real-Time-Bus-Tracker is an exercise that was assigned in the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN bootcamp. In this exercise, a real time bus tracker shows the location of buses. Users of the map can interact with the tracker by zooming in or by zooming out. In this exercise, we had to retrieve API keys. JavaScript's role in this activity was to fetch live bus related data from the API's and then show the locations of the buses. Markers are presented on the map of each bus for users to interact with.  </p>
